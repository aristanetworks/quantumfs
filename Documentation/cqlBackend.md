# CQL Backend

Package `github.com/aristanetworks/quantumfs/backends/cql` provides
a backend to store QuantumFSâ€™ data blocks and workspaceDB info in a CQL
compatible database. It has been verified to work with
[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) and
[Apache-Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/).

In order to use QuantumFS with the cql backend the CQL database needs to be setup
with the following schema:

```sql
CONSISTENCY ALL;
-- Setup keyspace and table for data blocks.
-- Keyspace: cqlKS
-- Table: blobstore
-- Keyspace name can be chosen by the database admins,
-- but the table name needs to be blobstore.
-- The {class,replication_factor} should be changed to whatever
-- deemed appropriate by the admins.
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS cqlKS
  WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cqlKS.blobstore ( key blob PRIMARY KEY, value blob );

-- Setup keyspace and table for workspaceDB info.
-- Keyspace: cqlKSwsdb
-- Table: workspaceDB
-- Keyspace name must be previous keyspacename+wsdb.
-- and the table name needs to be workspaceDB.
-- The {class,replication_factor} should be changed to whatever
-- deemed appropriate by the admins.
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS cqlKSwsdb
  WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cqlKSwsdb.workspacedb
  ( typespace text,
    namespace text,
    workspace text,
    key blob,
    nonce bigint,
    publishtime bigint,
    immutable boolean,
    PRIMARY KEY ( typespace, namespace, workspace ));
```

A config file is needed to tell QuantumFS the host(s) running the CQL database.
The config file also contains additional information such as the name of the 2
keyspaces and Time-To-live values for the data blocks.

A sample config file is present here:
```
backends/cql/cluster_configs/smoke_test_config
```

To start QuamtumFS with a CQL backend the command would be:
```
QFS_CONFIG=/path/to/config/file \
sudo quantumfsd -datastore cql.cql \
                -datastoreconf $QFS_CONFIG \
                -workspaceDB cql.cql \
                -workspaceDBconf $QFS_CONFIG
```

## Garbage Collection
QuantumFS does not maintain reference counts for its blocks. Space is reclaimed on
the CQL database by Time-To-Live(TTL) based garbage collection. So, in order
to prevent blocks from getting GCed due to an expiring TTL, we need to periodically
refresh the TTL values of the blocks in the database we want to keep.

The config file has 3 TTL values as explained below:
```
"adapter":
{
  "ttlrefreshtime" : "72h",   // If the TTL is less than this, we do not refresh TTL.
  "ttlrefreshvalue": "192h",  // The is the TTL value when a TTL value is refreshed.
  "ttldefaultvalue": "192h"   // This is the TTL for a new block.
}
```

The cqlwalkerd command/tool walks all the workspaces in QuantumFS and refreshes their
TTL based on the values above. In other words, all reachable blocks with a TTL less 
than ttlrefreshtime will have their TTL updated to ttlrefreshvalue.

## Long Running Tests
The CQL backend has a few long running tests which run against a docker
instance of the ScyllaDB. These tests take ~20mins to complete and can be run as
follows:

```bash
# Pull scylla docker, run container
docker pull scylladb/scylla
docker run --name some-scylla -p 9042:9042 -d scylladb/scylla \
           --broadcast-address 127.0.0.1  \
           --listen-address 0.0.0.0       \
           --broadcast-rpc-address 127.0.0.1
