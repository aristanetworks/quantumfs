QuantumFS is a distributed, branchable filesystem built on FUSE and heterogeneous
object stores. QuantumFS is a core component of Qubit.

For more information on Qubit, please see AID2967 and AID2985.
For more information on Quantumfs, please see AID3015.


Dev Environment Setup
---------------------

1) Ensure your GOPATH environment variable is correctly pointed such that this
README's folder path is $GOPATH/src/github.com/aristanetworks/quantumfs/README

2) Clone the dependent go libraries:

	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/aristanetworks/quantumfs
        make fetch

3) Compile and install the Google CityHash library:

	go get github.com/google/cityhash
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/cityhash
	./configure --enable-sse4.2
	make all check CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -msse4.2"
	sudo make install

4) Install protobufs:
	sudo yum install protobuf-devel

5) Ensure your /etc/fuse.conf has the "user_allow_other" line uncommented

6) Follow the instructions in QFSClient/README to install the prerequisites for
building QFSClient.

7) If you want to generate an RPM, you must also install fpm
(https://fpm.readthedocs.io).

Instructions
------------

* to compile:

	make all

* to generate an RPM:

	make rpm

Limits
------

* Maximum supported file size is 2.25 Petabytes

Signals
-------
Sending SIGUSR1 to quantumfsd will cause the read cache to be dropped and further
additions disallowed. This puts QuantumFS into a lower memory mode. This is useful,
for example, when attempting to gracefully upgrade QuantumFS to a newer version
without forcefully terminating existing users.
