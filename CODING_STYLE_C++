Coding Style
############

The coding style used in QuantumFS with C++ is generally defined using the Google C++
Style Guide[0] with the following modifications in order to be more similar to the
golang code:

1. Standard indentation is done using a single hard tab represented as eight spaces,
   not two spaces. Member access specifiers should be indented with four spaces.
2. The maximum recommended line length is 85 characters, not 80.
3. Braces are mandatory for all loops and 'if' statements.
4. Private members should not be named with a trailing underscore ("_"), as this
   conflicts with the QuantumFS golang convention that such functions have locking
   constraints.
5. All access to members of the current class must be via "this->".
